Is Love a Lost Cause(Poem) by Pretty Mohlabe

Is love a lost cause?
If it were
I wouldn’t be here.

Someone had to love me,
To die
And save me;

Someone had to leave his throne,
Go through shame
And redeem my place.

It wasn’t easy
But yet He did it;
Because He loves me.

This I know;
Love ain’t a lost cause;
For by it,
Are we drawn closer
To our creator
Who Himself
Is love.

IS LOVE A LOST CAUSE?

But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (Romans 5:8 KJV).

I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me (Galatians 2:20 KJV).

In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him (1 John 4:9 KJV).

Dear children, let’s not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions (1 John 3:18 NLT).

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment (Mark 12:30 KJV).

And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these (Mark 12:31 KJV).
